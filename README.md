# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project involves building and deploying a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health metrics. 
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset available on Kaggle. This repository contains the code, model, and analysis used to develop the prediction system.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationships between different health parameters and the target variable.
Model Development: Implementing several machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and others.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the models to improve their performance and minimize overfitting.
